Disclaimer: This is just a work to fill a gap in my repository since I have been exempted in this task.

My Role:
My current role in our group is project manager. I have been contributing by doing tasks that are related to my role such as: creating GANTT chart, charter, or any other project documents. I also help my partner to communicate with our stakeholders, facilitate the group and meetings, thought I might not be that competent as her. With those being said, I have learned that doing my part is crucial to team's success. I may not be that competent, but my contribution is needed so I must provide it along with the dedication to learn and expand my horizons.

Teamwork Experience:
Working with those people are fun, not gonna lie. Flaws are always expected to be present in any group so i personally didn't mind it at all. I think the overall experience went well,, while some stuff could be improved by sticking to the schedule, prioritizing our roles' work, communicating effective(which we are currently practicing right now). Overall, these are fun experience and the team did their best to contribute and help each other to achieve our shared goal. We are still learning and growing, so I think that is one thing to be cherished.

Personal Growth and Discipline:
As a PM, I would personally wanna improve my communication skills not just for expressing myself effectively, but to be able to establish a good rapport with every member of our group and to our stakeholders. Regarding my leadership skill, I do want to improve it especially when it comes to speaking in public, as well as my problem-solving skills even though I struggle or suck at programming or mathematical subjects I do think I can still become a much more efficient and effective PM. For now, I will improve those stuff that I mentioned, along with other personal competencies.
